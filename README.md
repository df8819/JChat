## JChat - A Python project for fun/educational purposes✨
The App uses the 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k' model as basis for a GPT-Chatbot

<em>(Model-Selector will be implemented Soon-ish™)</em>🙈

## This app is for you when:
- You have no experience with anything even remotely related to coding🧑‍💻
- You don't want to fumble around with 15 different requirements and requisitions🙄
- You want to play around with GPT in your own environment🤖
- You want to learn python. 350+ lines of code, many features, functions and other interesting stuff to explore🎉 Download an IDE like [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows), right click the 'JChat' folder and select 'Open Folder as PyCharm Project' to start exploring🔍
- You're looking for a python app with a clicky Tkinter-GUI instead of a console⚡

## Requirements
- **NO** coding skills or knowledge required😎
- A Windows environment👨‍💻 _(It works with other OS, but the setup process is for a Win distribution)_
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) _(Check the option "Add python.exe to PATH" when you install it)_
- [Git for Desktop](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Know how to 'copy & paste' and press buttons on a 'keyboard & mouse'🤔
- You need a [GPT API-Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) tho👀 That's not difficult in any means, but you need to have a paid plan from OpenAI.
<em>(They won't charge you if you're below 5$ for the first three months, which is nice and usually more than enough)</em>👍

## Setup / Execution
- Navigate to a folder you want JChat cloned to.
- Click into the 'address bar', type 'cmd' and hit enter.
- A 'CMD' window opens. You should see the path from your folder in the last line.
- Copy the following code, insert it into the open 'CMD' window and hit enter _(Right-Click acts as Ctrl+C and V in CMD💡)_:

```git clone https://github.com/df8819/JChat.git```

- The repository is now cloned _(downloaded/copied)_ to a new folder within the path you have chosen.
- Close this 'CMD' Window.
- Open the folder and execute 'Update.bat' if you run it for the first time🖖
- Watch the 'Update' script do its magic✨
- When the app opens for the first time, click 'API Key' and insert your key.
- For later instances, just use the 'Run.bat'👌

## Functionalities
- Normal Chat via Send button / Enter.
- 'Clear Chat' will clean up the Window _(does not delete saved chat conversation)_
- Change the behavior. Messy but fun😅 _(Default will act as the 'AI language model...' we all love)_😋
- Loop pre-defined answers endlessly. ❗WARNING❗ - This is an experimental feature and will burn your API limit FAST if not watched carefully! _('Cancel Loop' will immediately stop this function!)_
- Click 'API Key' to insert your key. The app will not work without your own key.
- Typing 'exit' in chat or clicking the 'Exit' button will close the app.

## End note
- Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
- Have fun🤗
