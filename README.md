# JChat
A simple App that uses the 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k' model to create a GPT-Chatbot _(Model-Selector will be implemented Soon-ish™)_

## This app is for you when:
- You have no experience with anything even remotely related to coding🧑‍💻
- You don't want to fumble around with 15 different requirements and requisitions🙄
- You want to play around with GPT in your own environment🤖
- You want to learn how to code. This app is written in +-300 lines of code and has many features, functions and other interesting stuff to explore🎉 Download an IDE like [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows), right click the 'JChat' folder and select 'Open Folder as PyCharm Project' to start exploring🔍
- You're looking for a python-app with an already existing and working code-basis and a clicky Tkinter-GUI🫡

## Requirements
- NO coding skills or knowledge required😎
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) _(Check the option "Add python.exe to PATH" when you install it)_
- [Git for Desktop](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Know how to 'copy & paste' and press buttons on a 'keyboard & mouse'🤔
- You need to have your own [GPT API-Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) tho👀 That's not difficult in any means, but you need to have a paid plan from OpenAI. _(They won't charge you if you're below 5$ for your monthly API calls, which is nice and usually more than enough)_

## Setup / Execution
- Navigate to a folder you want JChat cloned to.
- Click into the 'address bar', type 'cmd' and hit enter.
- A 'CMD' window opens. You should see the path from your folder in the last line.
- Copy the following code, insert it into the open 'CMD' window and hit enter _(Right-Click acts as Ctrl C/V in CMD💡)_:

 ```git clone https://github.com/df8819/JChat.git```

- The repository is now cloned _(downloaded/copied)_ to a new folder within the path you have chosen.
- Open the folder and execute 'Update.bat' if you run it for the first time, this will install all needed stuff🖖
- Watch the 'Update' script doing its magic🪄
- For later instances, just use the 'Run.bat'👌

## Functionalities
- Normal Chat via Send button / Enter.
- 'Clear Chat' will clean up the Window _(does not delete saved chat conversation)_
- Change the behavior. Messy but fun😅 _(Default will act as the 'As an AI language model...' we all love😋)_
- Loop pre-defined answers endlessly. ❗WARNING❗ - This is an experimental feature and will burn your API limit FAST if not watched carefully! _('Cancel Loop' will immediately stop this function!)_
- Click 'API Key' to insert your key. The app will not work without your own key.
- Typing 'exit' in chat or clicking the 'Exit' button will close the app.

## End note
- Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
- Have fun🤗
